summary: A simple browser add-on for dealing with cookies.

**Cookies** is a Webextension I created to help one of my co-workers scratch an itch.
After the introduction of Firefox Quantum he was without the means to quickly and efficiently
manage browser cookies for a while, the way he was used to before.

**Cookies** adds a toolbar button to turn on/off global browser cookies.

Future features:
