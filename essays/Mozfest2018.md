As a volunteer for Mozilla AMO (Addons), Mozilla invited me to MozFest this year.
October 25 through October 29 I, alongside other fellow Mozillians, embarked on an adventure through South East London, enjoying all the pecularities the city has to offer and engaging in a fact finding mission. 

**The goal:** Make [AMO](http://addons.mozilla.org/) more engaging.

This post serves as a short but (hopefully) meaningful summary of the events that transpired.
