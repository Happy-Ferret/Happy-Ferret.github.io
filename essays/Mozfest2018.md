summary: A summary of my experiences at and around MozFest2018 in London.
---

As a volunteer for Mozilla AMO (Addons), Mozilla invited me to MozFest this year.
October 25 through October 29 I, alongside other fellow Mozillians, embarked on an adventure through South East London, enjoying all the pecularities the city has to offer and engaging in a fact finding mission. 

**The task at hand:** Discover ways to make [AMO](http://addons.mozilla.org/) more engaging.

This post serves as a short but (hopefully) meaningful summary of the events that transpired.


## Thursday

## Friday

## Saturday

I arrived relatively late at Ravensbourne University and spent most of the afternoon preparing
for my 3 PM pitch. Being so focused on the opportunity to present [Anima](https://happy-ferret.github.io/projects/anima), I unfortunately missed out on the chance to print free custom stickers or posters. A service (I later found out) was only offered on Saturday ðŸ˜¿.

The pitch itself went rather well, alas I was glad I took down a whole slew of notes on my smartphone.
For 30 minutes (10 minutes per judge) I pitched my OS, answered the judges' burning questions and took notes of the criticism.
The main point of contention being the clear lack of a community. A fact that is somewhat disheartening, but sure to change with all the pointers I received in regards to *community engagement best practices*.

## Sunday

## Monday

## Conclusion

I had a great time at MozFest, met a number of interesting individuals, engaged with other project owners and, overall really had a blast. I can barely wait for MozFest2019. Fingers crossed I'll be invited again.

## Travel tips

* Unless you want to invest in a data plan, make sure to download an app that supports offline pedestrian maps.
Using Google Map's regular offline road maps was an absolute hell.

* If you happen to miss any basic items on your travels, Poundland (the UK's equivalent to Dollar Tree), Boots (similar to Rite Aid) and Marks & Spencer (decently priced clothing) should be your primary sources.

* Cab rides in London are fairly expensive. The London public transport system offers an affordable alternative, with most tube rides selling for less than 3 GBP. In some rare instances (I'd advise against taking the tube with a full set of luggage. Especially during peak hours) the luxury of a cab ride may well off-set the price though.
