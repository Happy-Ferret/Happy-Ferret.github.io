summary: A summary of my experiences at and around MozFest2018 in London.
---

As a volunteer for Mozilla AMO (Addons), Mozilla invited me to MozFest this year.
October 25 through October 29 I, alongside other fellow Mozillians, embarked on an adventure through South East London, enjoying all the pecularities the city has to offer and engaging in a fact finding mission. 

**The task at hand:** Discover ways to make [AMO](http://addons.mozilla.org/) more engaging.

This post serves as a short but (hopefully) meaningful summary of the events that transpired.


## Thursday

## Friday

## Saturday

I arrived relatively late at Ravensbourne University and then spent most of the afternoon preparing
for my 3 PM pitch. Being so focused on the opportunity to present [Anima](https://happy-ferret.github.io/projects/anima), I unfortunately missed out on the chance to print free custom stickers or posters. A service (I only later found out) was only offered on Saturday ðŸ˜¿.

## Sunday

## Monday

## Conclusion

I had a great time at MozFest, met a number of interesting individuals, engaged with other project owners and, overall really had a blast. I can barely wait for MozFest2019. Fingers crossed I'll be invited again.
