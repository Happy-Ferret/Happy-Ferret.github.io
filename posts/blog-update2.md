In preparation for a larger online presence, I've now added initial
support for an inline audio player.

For now, you can listen to some soothing Chopin (Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2).

Later on, I will obviously add content more in line with the topics discussed on this blog.

should have support for this format, some older browsers may lack this.</span>
