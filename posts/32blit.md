As many might not be aware, there's currently a Kickstarter for a small, DIY handheld game console
going on.

The stated main goal of the project is to teach people how to code, in a playful manner.

As somebody who is extremely passionate about software development (especially on resource constrained devices),
I naturally ordered one on the first day (I plan on ordering another one for my niece. If I can get her interested
in actually designing games over simply playing them ... sigh).


#### What I'm enthusiastic about

{:.ui .list}
* The inclusion of an SD card slot, allowing the physical distribution of games.
* Batteries included. Specifically tailored game development libraries for (Orthodox) C++ and Lua.
* The seemingly bright and colorful IPS display.

#### My hopes/plans

{:.ui .list}
* To create a tailor-made version of Middangeard, ditching the parser for multiple choice controls.
* To experiment with Go support on this particular chipset.
* I might revisit **Little Peter's Adventure**. A C64 game I originally started development on back in 2012,
upon the death of my previous cat.


#### What I'm sceptical about

{:.ui .list}
* The absence of a headphone jack is a bit of a bummer.
* While I personally don't crave it, I'm not yet convinced the lack of a touchscreen will appeal to
everybody.
