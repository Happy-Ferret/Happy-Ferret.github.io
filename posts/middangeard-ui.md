This is a quick sneak-peek of the first (there will be many, hopefully. Any Middangeard GUI is, after all, merely a messaging client to the engine)
UI for Middangeard.

It's written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and the final result will run atop [Go-Astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron).

I haven't come up with an actual (code-)name for it, yet. As a huge fan of Magnetic Scrolls and their Magnetic Windows game system,
I'm taking quite a few cues from their implementation. Mainly from the game [Wonderland](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/wonderland).

As I work on this, I'm hoping to add individual windows for the inventory, as well as eventual room graphics, maps (once Middangeard
supports mapping) and other vital information aiding a player's quest for adventure.

*Disclaimer: The icon used as background is in no shape or form an official Middangeard engine logo.
I simply needed a nice contrast to the otherwise white background and was looking for
an Anglo Saxon looking (as "Middangeard" itself is a Germanic term) clipart when this
popped up in my search results.*
